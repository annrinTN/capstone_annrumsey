# Hunger in America
<h2>Nashville Software School Data Analytics cohort DA2E capstone project</h2>


I am interested in exploring food security and the impact of hunger by identifying populations impacted by threats to the food supply. 
Established US government sources from the USDA for SNAP and WIC data are a key component of this analysis.   

<h2>Source data sets are from the USDA (United States Department of Agriculture)  </h2>
SNAP -  Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program  
USDA Food & Nutrition Service Child Nutrition and Food expenditures  
US Census tract data and 2010 population   
 Terminology:  
SNAP = Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program  
WIC = Women, Infants and Children (Food nutrition programs)  

<h2>The main question -- Who is food insecure?</h2>

Additional questions  
Is our current US SNAP program impacted by threats to the food supply / food safety?  
What age groups, demographics, or regions, urban or rural, etc.

What changes in SNAP over the years?  
Keeping up with the US population growth? 
Availability gaps if any  
Who gets SNAP benefits / who does not?  
Types of foods / trends costs  

<h2>Tools used: </h2>
  Python, Tableau, Excel, and Power BI (correlation plot R package)
