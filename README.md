I am interested in exploring food security and the impact of hunger by identifying populations impacted by threats to the food supply. 
The established US government sources for SNAP and WIC data are a key component of this analysis. 

Who is food insecure?
Is our current US SNAP program impacted by threats to the food supply / food safety?
What age groups, demographics, or regions, urban or rural, etc.?

What changes in SNAP over the years?
Keeping up with the US population growth?
Availability gaps if any
Who gets SNAP benefits / who does not?
Types of foods / trends? 
Costs
